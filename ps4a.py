Problem 1.
Write a function, called nestEggFixed, which takes four arguments: a salary, a
percentage of your salary to save in an investment account, an annual growth percentage
for the investment account, and a number of years to work. This function should return a
list, whose values are the size of your retirement account at the end of each year, with the
most recent year's value at the end of the list.
Complete the implementation of:
def nestEggFixed (salary, save, growthRate, years):

Retirement fund
End of year 1 F[0] = salary * save * 0.01
End of year 2 F[1] = F[0] * (1 + 0.01 * growthRate) + salary * save * 0.01
End of year 3 F[2] = F[1] * (1 + 0.01 * growthRate) + salary * save * 0.01

      integer between 0 and 100).
